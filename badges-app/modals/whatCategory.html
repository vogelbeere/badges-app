                Categories align to the Brookes Guiding Principles: Confidence, Enterprising Creativity, Connectedness and Generosity of Spirit. 
                Each activity that you complete earns you an achievement that has been assigned to one of these principles.
            </p>
            <p>
                Achievements you have earned are displayed in bold colour with a star; activities you have signed up for, but have not yet completed, are displayed as faded with a tick.
            </p>
